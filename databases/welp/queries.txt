There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
- COMMAND
	SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
	FROM users
	INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id
	INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

- OUTPUT
	Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Great food!
	Angela|Jolie|Sushi World|3|Not the best but not the worst sushi I ever had.
	Denzel|George|Lotus Yoga|4|Good classes. The teachers really care
	Holly|Berry|The Beagle Nightclub|5|HAD SUCH A BLAST!!!!!!!
	Angela|Jolie|Amir's Towing|1|A totally scam of a business. You are better off hitchhiking then getting these guys to tow your car
	Merryl|Streepman|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|100000|Thank you, thank you, thank you people at Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
