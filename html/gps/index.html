What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
-HTML5 semantic tags makes it eeasier to read code but more importantly prhe programs, for instance, that reads the page for someone is blind gives more detial about what is on the page.
- I think all of them are useful but it more depends on what kind of page you are making.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
- It goes from top to bottom and left to right.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
- I learn more about how snippets work and how to write one. I would create one or more at a later date. Like a table one I think would be really useful.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
- I feel I have a pretty good understanding of HTML but would look more into HTML5 semantic elements. I believe it still fairy new.
