What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

GET request data from a specified resource
POST Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

POST can transmit a larger amount of information than GET

### GET advantages
URLs can be bookmarked safely
Pages can be reloaded safely


Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

Cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browing.

Cookies are use to remember stateful information like when you push a button, logging in, or recording which pages were visited before.
