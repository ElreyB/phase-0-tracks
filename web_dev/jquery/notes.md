Videos
YouTube - I am a very visiual person so videos help me out a great deal. I am also a very social person. Even though it is a video it gives me a more person to person feel.

Sites
SoloLearn - if they have the subject
I like SoloLearn because its short, detail lessons with a quiz. Then at the end there is an over all test. This helps with my kinetic side.

Tresshouse - this may take longer than 2 hours
Same as the SoloLearn site

jquery tutorial websites - to see what is out there and the different ways to learn it.

Read
Read some of the chapters in JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett
I really like this book. I am not a big reader but this book format is really good for those of us who not big readers

Take a break a the 30min mark - usaully with something really new, the 30min break point helps reset my brain.
