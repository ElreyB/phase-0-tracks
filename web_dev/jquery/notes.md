YouTube - I am a very visiual person so videos help me out a great deal. I am also a very social person. Even though it is a video it gives me a more person to person feel.

Sites
SoloLearn - if they have the subject
I like SoloLearn because its short, detail lessons with a quiz. Then at the end there is an over all test. This helps with my kinetic side.

Tresshouse - this may take longer than 2 hours
Same as the SoloLearn site

jquery tutorial websites - to see what is out there and the different ways to learn it.

Read
Read some of the chapters in JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett
I really like this book. I am not a big reader but this book format is really good for those of us who not big readers

Take a break a the 30min mark - usaully with something really new, the 30min break point helps reset my brain.

It turns out that I had already subscribed to LearnCode.academy on youtube. I really like it because they are short, detial, and the host is fun to listen to.

Sites
SoloLearn - just as i thought it would this site was really good at going over the basics. You feel accomplished when you are able to take the test and past without looking back or looking things up. It is set up really well.

TreeHouse - they did not have a jQuery track

jQuery tutorial websites - I found a couple docs and bookmark them.

Read - I really like this book a look. It is great to referrence to and is set up in a way that really appeals to me.

take breaks - it is always good to take breaks when learning soemthing. I am not really good at remember when I don't take breaks. I end up mixing things up in my head if I don't of just for get to eat or use the bathroom sometimes. Also, without breaks I get really antsy. instead of learning I jsut want to get throught things without really learning anything.
